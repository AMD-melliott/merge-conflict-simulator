# Merge Conflict Simulator

## Exercise Goal
Learn how to resolve merge conflicts using VS Code's visual conflict resolution tools.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Checkout the branch `update-date`
3. Edit the date in `meeting_minutes.md` and commit your change
4. Try to merge changes from `main` (which has a different date)
5. Use VS Code's conflict resolution buttons to resolve the conflict
6. Commit the resolution

## Expected Outcome
You'll see VS Code highlight the conflict with clickable options:
- Accept Current Change
- Accept Incoming Change
- Accept Both Changes
- Compare Changes

This exercise teaches you that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're just decisions!
